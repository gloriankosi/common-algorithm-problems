# common-algorithm-problems

While I wrote all the source code for the problems, the solutions are not unique. There exists many solutions (most of which perform better) of the 
problems listed, some are almost non distinguishable, others are a completely different approach. Not to mention that
when I did get stuck on a problem, I did look at extra resources (documents, stackoverflow, etc) for help. 


NOTE: I AM NOT THE FIRST TO SOLVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS (I FOUND THESE PROBLEMS ONLINE AND THEY HAD SOLUTIONS AFTER YOU SUBMIT YOUR ATTEMPT - THIS IS CODECHEF AND HACKERRANK)
