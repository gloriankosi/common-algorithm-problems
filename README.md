# common-algorithm-problems

While I wrote all the source code for the problems, the solutions are not unique. There exists many solutions of the 
problems listed, some are almost non distinguishable, others are a completely different approach. Not to mention that
when I did get stuck on a problem, I did look at extra resources (documents, stackoverflow, etc) for help.
